In this chapter we shall describe in detail the process of setup, simulation and post-processing for some SedFOAM test cases
All the tutorial cases are in the tutorial directory. The text herein is highly inspired from the OpenFOAM user-guide for the cavity turorial available at http://cfd.direct/openfoam/user-guide/cavity/ but is adapted to the specificity of sedFoam.


\section  Sedim_testcase Pure sedimentation: 1DSedim

This tutorial will describe how to pre-process, run and post-process a case corresponding to a pure sedimentatiton problem in a one-dimensional configuration using the two-phase flow equations. The geometry is shown in Figure 1 in which bottom boundary is a wall and the top boundary is an open boundary.  Initially, the flow is at rest and will be solved on a uniform mesh using the sedFoam solver for laminar, isothermal, incompressible two-phase flow. The numerical results are compared with experiments to validate the model in terms of settling curves, time evolution of concentration interface, and concentration profiles.

\subsection preproc Pre-processing

Like in OpenFOAM, cases are setup by editing case files using a text editor such as emacs, vi, gedit, nedit, etc. The I/O uses a dictionary format with keywords. A case involves data for mesh, fields, properties, control parameters, etc  that are stored in a set of files within a case directory rather than in a single case file. The case directory is given a suitably descriptive name. This tutorial consists of a set of cases located in the sedFoam distribution under the folder sedFoamDirectory/tutorials/1DSedim. 

\subsubsection meshgen Mesh generation

OpenFOAM always operates in a 3 dimensional Cartesian coordinate system and all geometries are generated in 3 dimensions. OpenFOAM solves the case in 3 dimensions by default but can be instructed to solve in 2 dimensions by specifying a ‘special’ empty boundary condition on boundaries normal to the (3rd) dimension for which no solution is required. In 2 dimensions, the directions x and y are always chosen even if the mesh is given in the x-z plane.

The sedimentation domain consists of a square of side length L = 0.006 m in the x–y plane and of height h=0.06 m in the vertical direction z. The side lentgh is chosen to ensure a unity cell aspect ratio. A uniform mesh of 1 by 1 by 100 cells will be used. The block structure is shown in Figure 1.

The mesh generator supplied with OpenFOAM, blockMesh, generates meshes from a description specified in an input dictionary, blockMeshDict located in the constant/polyMesh directory for a given case. The blockMeshDict entries for this case are as follows:

The file first contains header information in the form of a banner (lines 1-7), then file information contained in a FoamFile sub-dictionary, delimited by curly braces ({…}). 

The file first specifies coordinates of the block vertices; it then defines the blocks (here, only 1) from the vertex labels and the number of cells within it; and finally, it defines the boundary patches. The user is encouraged to consult the offical documentation
<a href="http://cfd.direct/openfoam/user-guide/blockMesh/#x25-1750005.3">here</a>
to understand the meaning of the entries in the *blockMeshDict* file.


The mesh is generated by running blockMesh on this blockMeshDict file. From within the case directory, this is done, simply by typing in the terminal: 

\verbatim
blockMesh
\endverbatim

The running status of blockMesh is reported in the terminal window. Any mistakes in the blockMeshDict file are picked up by blockMesh and the resulting error message directs the user to the line in the file where the problem occurred. There should be no error messages at this stage.


\subsubsection BC_init Boundary and initial conditions

Once the mesh generation is complete, the user can look at this initial fields set up for this case. The case is set up to start at time t = 0 s, so the initial field data is stored in a 0_org sub-directory of the 1DSedim directory. The 0_org sub-directory contains several files: alpha, Ua, Ub, p, muI, pa, Theta, one for each of the solid phase volume fraction (alpha), velocities of solid and fluid phases (Ua and Ub), the pressure (p) fields whose initial values and boundary conditions must be set. Let us examine file Ua:

\verbatim
dimensions      [0 1 -1 0 0 0 0];

internalField   uniform (0 0 0);

boundaryField
{
    inlet
    {
        type            cyclic;
    }
    outlet
    {
        type            cyclic;
    }
    top
    {
        type            zeroGradient;
    }
    bottom
    {
        type            fixedValue;
        value           uniform (0 0 0);
    }
    frontAndBackPlanes
    {
        type            empty;
    }
}

\endverbatim

There are 3 principal entries in field data files:

dimensions
    specifies the dimensions of the field, here velocity, i.e. m s\f$^{-1}\f$ ; 
internalField
    the internal field data which are set to be uniform; 
boundaryField
    the boundary field data that includes boundary conditions and data for all the boundary patches.

For this case 1DSedim, the boundary consists of cyclic boundaries at the inlet and outlet (left and right boundaries) and walls at the top and bottom boundaries, the top boundary is zeroGradient whereas the bottom boundary is a no-slip boundary conditions i.e zero velocity at the wall. The frontAndBack patch represents the front and back planes of the 2D case and therefore must be set as empty. 

The user can similarly examine the fluid phase velocity field in the 0_org/Ub file. The solid phase volume fraction has zeroGradient boundary conditions at the top and bottom boundaries whereas the pressure has fixedValue at the top boundary (equivalent to setting the atmospheric pressure) and a fixedFluxPressure at the bottom boundary. We shall explain below what this boundary condition means.

\subsubsection PhysProp Physical properties

The physical properties for the case are stored in dictionaries whose names are given the suffix …Properties, located in the Dictionaries directory tree. For a sedFoam case, there are 8 property files: transportProperties, interfacialProperties, ppProperties, granularRheologyProperties, kineticTheoryProperties, RASProperties  twophaseRASProperties 

In the transport property file, the physical properties of the solid and fluid phases are set, such as density, kinematic viscosity and particle diameter. 

\verbatim
// * * * * * * * * * * * * sediment properties * * * * * * * * * * * * //
phasea
{   
    rho             rho [ 1 -3 0 0 0 ] 1050;
    nu              nu [ 0 2 -1 0 0 ] 1e-6;
    d               d [ 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 ] 290e-6;    
    hExp            hExp [ 0 0  0 0 0 0 0 ] 3.15;  // hindrance exponent for drag: beta^(-hExp) (2.65 by default)
}
// * * * * * * * * * * * * fluid properties * * * * * * * * * * * * //
phaseb
{   
    rho             rho [ 1 -3 0 0 0 ] 950;
    nu              nu [ 0 2 -1 0 0 ] 2.105e-05;
    d               d [ 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 ] 290e-6;
}
//*********************************************************************** //
transportModel  Newtonian;

nu              nu [ 0 2 -1 0 0 0 0 ] 2.105e-05;

nuMax           nuMax [0 2 -1 0 0 0 0] 1e-1;      // viscosity limiter for the Frictional model (required for stability)

alphaSmall      alphaSmall [ 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 ] 1e-6;  // minimum volume fraction (phase a) for division by alpha

\endverbatim

The hindrance function exponent of the Richardson-Zaki law can be tuned using the parameter hExp. This is important for this first test case which is in the laminar regime for the drag. The transportModel has to be prescribed when using turbulence model, it is present here for compatibility with the other test cases. The nuMax value is a viscosity limiter for the all the viscosities, it allows the user to control the numerical stability of the solver and will be discussed in the second test case. It is especially important as some shear stress terms are discretized explicitely and that the frictional viscosity can reach huge values. The alphaSmall value is used to regularise the division by alpha in the source code, the default value is set to \f$ 10^{-6} \f$. 
 
The dictionary *interfacialProperties* allows to specify the drag model:

\verbatim
dragModela      GidaspowSchillerNaumann;

dragModelb      GidaspowSchillerNaumann;

dragPhase       a;
\endverbatim

The model chosen here is GidaspowSchilerNaumann that corresponds to the drag force around a spherical particle corrected by a hindrance function (\f$ \beta^{-hExp}\f$).

The dictionary *ppProperties* contains the informations concerning the permanent contact contribution to the solid phase pressure. In sedFoam, the model of Johnson and Jackson (1987) is used: 

\f$ p_{ff} = Fr \frac{\left( \alpha - \alpha_{min}^{Friction} \right)^{\eta}}{\left(\alpha_{Max} - \alpha \right)^p} \f$ 

\verbatim
alphaMax        0.635;

alphaMinFriction alphaMinFriction [ 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 ] 0.57;

Fr               Fr [ 1 -1 -2 0 0 0 0 ] 5e-2;

eta              eta [ 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 ] 3;

p                p [ 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 ] 5;

\endverbatim

And the dictionary *granularRheologyProperties* controls the granular rheology part:

\verbatim
granularRheology   on;

alphaMaxG       alphaMaxG [ 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 ] 0.6;

mus             mus  [ 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 ] 0.4;

mu2             mu2  [ 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 ] 0.9;

I0              I0  [ 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 ] 0.6;

Bphi            Bphi [ 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 ] 0.66;

n               n [ 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 ] 1.;

Dsmall          Dsmall [ 0 0 -1 0 0 0 0 ] 1e-4;

relaxPa         relaxPa [ 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 ] 0.005;

FrictionModel   Coulomb;

PPressureModel  none;

FluidViscosityModel KriegerDougherty;

\endverbatim 

On the first line the switch granularRheology allows to turn on and off this module. The keywords FrictionModel, PPressureModel and FluidViscosityModel allow to choose the friction model between none, Coulomb, MuI and MuIv, the shear induced particle pressure model between none, MuI and MuIv and the effective viscosity model between none (=pure fluid), Einstein, KriegerDougherty and BoyerEtAl.  

For the present case the granularRheology is set to Coulomb and the FluidViscosityModel is used for the effective viscosity model and a Krieger and Dougherty (1959) model is used. All the details concerning the different models can be found in the Geophysical Model Development paper on sedFoam.  

The remaining dictionaries are not used for this tutorial and will not be detailled here. Their content will be explained in the next tutorials when they are used.

\subsubsection control_sedFoam Control

Input data relating to the control of time and reading and writing of the solution data are read in from the controlDict dictionary. The user should view this file; as a case control file, it is located in the system directory.

The start/stop times and the time step for the run must be set. OpenFOAM offers great flexibility with time control which is described in full in section 4.3. In this tutorial we wish to start the run at time t = 0 which means that OpenFOAM needs to read field data from a directory named 0. Therefore we set the startFrom keyword to startTime and then specify the startTime keyword to be 0. 

As the simulation progresses we wish to write results at certain intervals of time that we can later view with a post-processing package. The writeControl keyword presents several options for setting the time at which the results are written; here we select the adjustableRunTime option which specifies that results are written every writeInterval seconds of simulated time, adjusting the time steps to coincide with the writeInterval if necessary and the time step is automatically adjusted using adjustTimeStep = on. The time step controled using different criteria on Courant numbers based on the maximum velocity, the relative velocity (\f$ U_r=U_b-U_a \f$) and the interfacial courant number. The maximum values of the Courant numbers (maxCo and maxAlphaCo) are set in the controlDict and the maximum value of the time step is controlled by the parameter maxDeltaT.

OpenFOAM creates a new directory named after the current time, e.g. 0.1 s, on each occasion that it writes a set of data, as discussed in full in section 4.1. In the icoFoam solver, it writes out the results for each field, U and p, into the time directories. For this case, the entries in the controlDict are shown below: 

\verbatim
application     sedFoam;

startFrom       startTime;

startTime       0;

stopAt          endTime;

endTime         1800;

writeControl    adjustableRunTime;

writeInterval   30;

adjustTimeStep  on;

maxCo           0.1;

maxAlphaCo      0.1;

maxDeltaT       1e-2;
\endverbatim


\subsubsection Disc_solv Discretisation and linear-solver settings

The numerical schemes and linear solvers are set in the system/fvSchemes and system/fvSolution files respectively. 

Concerning the numerical schemes, the time discretisation is a Euler implicit scheme, the divergence terms are of Gauss limitedLinear type (2nd order centered schemes with a Sweby limiter) and the laplacian scheme is Gauss linear corrected for all terms. The fvScheme file is shown below:

\verbatim
ddtSchemes
{
    default         Euler implicit;
}

gradSchemes
{
        default         Gauss linear;
}

divSchemes
{
    default         none;
// alphaEqn
    div(phi,alpha)  Gauss limitedLinear01 1;
    div(phir,alpha) Gauss limitedLinear01 1;
// UEqn
    div(phia,Ua)    Gauss limitedLinearV 1;
    div(phib,Ub)    Gauss limitedLinearV 1;
    div(phiRa,Ua)   Gauss limitedLinear 1;
    div(phiRb,Ub)   Gauss limitedLinear 1;
// pEqn
    div(alpha,nu)   Gauss linear;
}

laplacianSchemes
{
    default         none;
// UEqn
    laplacian(nuEffa,Ua) Gauss linear corrected;
    laplacian(nuEffb,Ub) Gauss linear corrected;
    laplacian(nuFra,Ua)  Gauss linear corrected;
// pEqn
    laplacian((rho*(1|A(U))),p) Gauss linear corrected;
}

interpolationSchemes
{
    default  linear;
}

snGradSchemes
{
    default         corrected;
}

fluxRequired
{
    default         no;
    p               ;
}
\endverbatim

In the system/fvSolution file, the user can specify the linear solver he/she wants to use for each equation and the tolerance for the resolution. The user can also control the number of corrector steps and non-orthogonal correctors (useles for cartesian grids) for the PIMPLE algorithm. In the present case, a single PIMPLE corrector is enough the residual of the pressure equation is shown to converge well. The fvSolution file is reproduced below:

\verbatim

    p
    {
        solver          GAMG;
        tolerance       1e-09;

    }

    pRefValue       0;
}
\endverbatim
// \subsection viewmesh Viewing the mesh

\subsection run_sedFoam Running sedFoam

The easiest way to run the test case is to run the shell script:

\verbatim
# Create the mesh
blockMesh

# create the intial time folder
cp -r 0_org 0

# Initialize the alpha field
funkySetFields -time 0

# Write the mesh in folder 0/
writeCellCentres -time 0

# Run sedFoam
sedFoam > log&
\endverbatim

The script is self documented, the blockMesh command has already been introduced. The initial condition stored in the 0_org folder is first copied to the zero (0) folder. The command funkySetFields (require swak4foam library) allows to set the initial solid phase volume fraction profile following an hyperbolic tangent profile described in the dictionnary *system/funkySetFieldsDict* as folows:

\verbatim
expressions
 (      
        alpha1
        {
                field alpha;
                expression "0.5*0.5*(1.0+tanh((pos().y-0.054)/(0.0490-pos().y)*10.0))";
                keepPatches 1;
        }       
        alpha2
        {
                field alpha;
                expression "0.5";
                condition "pos().y < 0.049";
                keepPatches 1;
        }
 );
\endverbatim

The command writeCellCentres write the coordinates of the cell centers in the 0 folder for future postprocessing using python.

The code is run using the command sedFoam in the terminal. The "> log &" allows to run the code in batch and write the output in the file log. The run can be monitored using the command 

\verbatim
tail -100 log
\endverbatim

// comment: Shall we replace the batch execution by an interactive run to avoid beginners to run multiple times the code without knowing how to kill the process.

\subsection post Post-processing 

\subsubsection postparaview Using paraview

The reader is reffered to the OpenFOAM tutorial for the lid driven cavity for the basic manipulation on paraview such as viewing loading the data or viewing the mesh (http://cfd.direct/openfoam/user-guide/cavity/).

\subsubsection postfluidfoam Using fluidfoam

The postprocessing using python requires the installation of the package fluidfoam available at hg clone https://bitbucket.org/sedfoam/fluidfoam. If the pacakage is installed properly with all the dependencies, you just have to run the python script *plot_tutoSedimentation.py* located in the folder *tutorials/Py*:

\verbatim
python plot_tutoSedimentation.py
\endverbatim 

and you should see the following figures:

@image html "res1_tuto1.png" "Figure 2: Comparison of two-phase numerical results with experiments of Pham Van Bang et al. (2006) for the settling curves: time evolution of the lower and upper interface positions (circles: experiments ; lines: model).  " width=100px

\section BedLoadCLB Laminar bedLoad: 1DBedload


We consider a flat particle bed submitted to a Poiseuille
flow driven by a pressure gradient in a horizontal channel. This situation has been studied experimentally, analytically and numerically by Ouriemi et al. (2009) and Aussillous et al. (2013). The goal of this tutorial is to illustrate the ability of sedFoam to reproduce dense granular flows using the dense granular flow rheology \f$\mu(Iv)\f$. For this purpose sedFoam will be first compared with the analytical solution from Aussillous et al. (2013) using a Coulomb friction rheology. In a second part, the results obtained using the \f$\mu(Iv)\f$ rheology are compared with a simple 1D numerical model.
  

\subsection preprocBL Pre-processing

This tutorial is distributed with sedFoam2.0 under the folder sedFoamDirectory/tutorials/1DBedLoad.

\subsubsection meshgenBL Mesh generation

The numerical domain consists of a square of side length L = 0.0065 m in the x-y plane and of height h=0.065 m in the vertical direction z. The side lentgh is chosen to ensure a unity cell aspect ratio. A uniform mesh of 1 by 1 by 200 cells will be used. The block structure is the same as for the Sedimentation test case and is shown in Figure 1.

The mesh is generated by running blockMesh from within the case directory:

\verbatim
blockMesh
\endverbatim

\subsubsection BC_initiBL Boundary and initial conditions

The case is set up to start at time t = 0 s, again the initial field data are stored in a 0_org sub-directory of the case directory. The 0_org sub-directory contains several files: alpha, Ua, Ub, p, muI, pa, Theta, one for each of the solid phase volume fraction (alpha), velocities of solid and fluid phases (Ua and Ub), the pressure (p) fields whose initial values and boundary conditions must be set. Compared with the sedimentation test case, no-slip boundary conditions are imposed for both phase velocity at the top and bottom boundaries.

\endverbatim

The physical property of the particles (diameter and density) and of the fluid (density and kinematic viscosity) have been set to the experimental values from Aussillous et al. (2013).  

In the dictionary *interfacialProperties* file the drag model from GidaspowShcillerNaumann has been kept, the influence of the drag model on this test case as the relative velocity between the fluid and the particles is negligible. 
 
Compared with the sedimentation test case, the *granularRheologyProperties* is critical. The file is shown below: 

\verbatim

PPressureModel  none;

FluidViscosityModel  Einstein;
\endverbatim
             
To compare with the analytical solution, the Coulomb Frictional model and the Einstein FluidViscosity model are used. No PPressureModel is specified meaning that the shear induced contribution to the solid phase pressure is not included i.e. the solid phase volume fraction profile must be sharp at the particle bed interface. The value of the rehological constants are chosen following Aussillous et al. (2013). The regularisation parameter Dsmall is taken as 1e-4, this is shown to be enough for this case but a sensitivity analysis could be performed in case of a too strong creeping flow in the particle bed.

\section SheetFlow Turbulent sheet-flows: 1DSheetFlow

In this tutorial, the turbulent flow over a flat erodible bed drives sediment transport in the intense turbulent bedload tranpsort regime usually referred to as sheet-flow. The results are compared with experimental data from Revil-Baudard et al. (2015). Light-weight non-spherical PMMA particles of median diameter d=3 mm are used having a settling velocity in quiescent water of about \f$W_{fall}=0.059\f$ m/s. The averaged flow velocity is about U=0.52 m/s corresponding to a bed friction velocity of \f$u_*=0.05\f$ m/s and a dimensionless bed shear stress, the so-called Shields number \f$\theta\f$, equal to 0.44.

\subsubsection meshgenSF Mesh generation

The numerical domain consists of a square of side length L = 0.00085 m in the x-y plane and of height h=0.17 m in the vertical direction z. The side lentgh is chosen to ensure a unity cell aspect ratio. A uniform mesh of 1 by 1 by 400 cells will be used. The block structure is the same as for the Sedimentation test case and is shown in Figure 1.

The mesh is generated by running blockMesh from within the case directory:

\subsubsection BC_initiSF Boundary and initial conditions

The case is set up to start at time t = 0 s, again the initial field data are stored in a 0_org sub-directory of the case directory. The 0_org sub-directory contains several files: alpha, Ua, Ub, p, muI, pa, Theta, k, epsilon, omega and nut one for each of the solid phase volume fraction (alpha), velocities of solid and fluid phases (Ua and Ub), the pressure (p) fields whose initial values and boundary conditions must be set. No-slip boundary conditions are imposed at the bottom and zero gradient at the top for both phase velocities.

The physical property of the particles (diameter and density) and of the fluid (density and kinematic viscosity) have been set to the experimental values from Revil-Baudard et al. (2015).  

In the dictionary *interfacialProperties* file the drag model from GidaspowSchillerNaumann is used and the shape factor sF is taken to 0.5 to match the settling velocity of a single particle with the measured data (w_fall = 0.056 m/s).
 
The *granularRheologyProperties* is similar to the one for the 1DBedLoadMuI case:

\verbatim

PPressureModel MuI;

FluidViscosityModel  BoyerEtAl;
\endverbatim
             
For this case, the dense granular flow rheology \f$\mu(I)\f$ is used and the parameters are set according to Chauchat (2017). The differences with the laminar bed load case is the use of the inertial regime of the \f$\mu(I)\f$ rheology instead of the viscous one, the use of the shear induced pressure (PPressureModel) and the effective fluid viscosity model (FluidViscosityModel) from Boyer et al. (2011) is used.

\section Scour Scour downstream of an apron: 2DScourApron

In this 2D configuration, we are looking at the scour development downstream of an apron. Following the numerical study of Amoudry & Liu (2009) and Cheng et al. (2017), the scour problem
is simplified and sketched in figure 7.

\subsubsection meshgenSA Mesh generation

The numerical domain consists of a rectangle of side length L = 0.5 m in the x-y plane and of height h=0.25 m in the vertical direction z, where the flow depth is chosen to be  \f$h_0\f$ = 0.15m, and
the initial bed depth is  \f$h_b\f$ = 0.05m. A regular grid is used in the vertical direction for the sediment bed (50 elements along the vertical direction) and in horizontal direction (250 elements). Inside the water column, 100 grid points are used with an increasing cell ratio of 2 along the vertical direction. Please note that this coarse mesh is for tutorial purpose only. If you want a finer mesh you may refer to Chauchat et al. (2017). The block structure is shown in Figure 7.

\subsubsection  BC_initiSA Boundary and initial conditions

The case is set up to start at time t = 0 s, as for the previous 1D tutorials the initial fields data are stored in the 0_org sub-directory of the case directory.

The bottom boundary, the lower part of the inlet (forming the step) and of the outlet are set as wall boundaries. The upper part of the inlet is an inlet boundary where the velocity profile is imposed according to the rough wall log law (eq. (73) in Chauchat et al. (2017)) via the GroovyBC utility. Turbulent quantities are imposed as constant values following recommendation from esi group (http://www.esi-cfd.com/content/view/877/192/). At the outlet, a directionMixed boundary condition is used for the velocities of both phases (zeroGradient for streamwise component and zero value for the vertical one) and the hydrostatic pressure is imposed thanks to the GroovyBC utility. 
As initial condition, the velocity of both phases, the sediment concentration, the TKE and the TKE dissipation are set based on one-dimensional simulation results using funkySetFields. The details of the boundary conditions are summarized in the following table:

\subsubsection Disc_solvSF Discretisation and linear-solver settings

The numerical schemes and the solvers are the same as in the 1DSheetFlow case.

\subsubsection control_sedFoamSF Control

The system/controlDict file indicates that for this case the time step is equal to \f$ 2.10^{-4}\f$ s and that the computation ends at 60s of dynamics. The output write interval has been set to 5s by default. The user is invited to reduce it in order to capture the evolution of the scour hole more accurately.   

\verbatim
application     sedFoam;

startFrom       latestTime;

startTime       0;

stopAt          endTime;

endTime         60;

\subsubsection  lauch_SA Computation launching

As for the previous cases, you can lauch the computation by executing <EM> Allrun </EM>. This shell script contains two lines specific to the present multidimensionnal case:

\verbatim
# Decompose the case in order to run in parallel (on 4 cores)
decomposePar

# Run sedFoam in parallel
mpirun -np 4 sedFoam -parallel > log&
\endverbatim
First of all, as the mesh is composed of 37500 cells, computation runs faster on several processors (the best compromise is of 10000 cells per core). Here, the <EM> decomposePar  </EM> command decompose the initial time (specified in the <EM> controlDict </EM> file) in the number of part specified in the </EM> system/decomposeParDict </EM> file.

The second command specify that the computation is launched in parallel with </EM> mpirun </EM>.

\subsection postSF Post-processing using python

You just have to run the python script *plot_tuto2DScour.py* located in the folder *tutorials/Py*:

\verbatim
python plot_tuto2DScour.py
\endverbatim

and you should see the following figures:
